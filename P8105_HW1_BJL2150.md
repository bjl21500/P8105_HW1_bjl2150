Problem 1
=========

Creating data frame
-------------------

``` r
Problem1_df = tibble(
  x = runif(10, min=0, max=5), 
  vec_numeric = c(x>2),
  vec_char = c("Giraffe", "Elephant", "Lion", "Wolf", "Dolphin", "Ant", "Dog", 
               "Tiger", "Bird", "Fish" ),
  vec_logical = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, 
                  FALSE),
  vec_factor = factor(c("African descent", "White", "Asian", "Native American", 
                        "Virgin Islander", "St. Thomian", "St. Johnian", "Crucian", 
                        "Floridian", "Atlantian"))
  )
```

``` r
# Taking the mean of x variable

mean(Problem1_df$x)
```

    ## [1] 2.841261

This code works because x is a numeric variable. The mean of x equals 2.136482.

``` r
# Taking the mean of vec_numeric

mean(Problem1_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

Taking the mean of the numeric vector produces 0.3 as the output. Therefore, this code works.

``` r
# Taking the mean of vec_char

mean(Problem1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Problem1_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This code does not work. An error message states that "this argument is not numeric or logical".

``` r
# Taking the mean of vec_logical

mean(Problem1_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.4

This code does output a value for the mean of the logical vector. The mean of this vector equals 0.4.

``` r
# Taking the mean of vec_factor

mean(Problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Problem1_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This code does not work because the vector is neither numeric nor logical.

``` r
## 1st code chunk
# Using the as.numeric function to the logical, character and factor vectors.

as.numeric(Problem1_df$vec_logical)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0

``` r
as.numeric(Problem1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(Problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ##  [1]  1 10  2  6  9  8  7  4  5  3

When this function was used on the logical and factor vectors, numeric values were created.With the character vector, it could not be applied (NA).

``` r
# 2nd code chunk
# Converting character variable from character to factor to numeric

## Created a new variable named 'Factor' that is the end product of converting
# the character vector to the factor vector.
Factor = as.factor(Problem1_df$vec_char)

#Converted the Factor variable to a numeric vector.
as.numeric(Factor)
```

    ##  [1]  7  5  8 10  4  1  3  9  2  6

``` r
## Converting factor variable from factor to character to numeric

Character = as.character(Problem1_df$vec_factor)

as.numeric(Character)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

In the first portion of the code chunk, the character vector was converted from a character to a factor and lastly to a numeric vector. This vector was converted successfully into the factor the numeric vectors.

Conversion of the factor vector to the character vector was successsful. However, converting that new vector (Character) into a numeric vector was not successful. An error message was displayed.

Problem 2
=========

Creating data frame
-------------------

``` r
x = rnorm(1000)
y = rnorm(1000)
vec_logical = c(x + y > 0)

Problem2_df = tibble(
  x,
  y,
  vec_logical)

# Converted logical vector to a numeric vector.
vec_numeric = as.numeric(Problem2_df$vec_logical)

# Converted logical vector to a factor vector.
vec_factor = as.factor(Problem2_df$vec_logical)

dim(Problem2_df)
```

    ## [1] 1000    3

``` r
mean(x)
```

    ## [1] 0.05959712

``` r
median(x)
```

    ## [1] 0.04598577

``` r
mean(Problem2_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.513

The logical vector was converteed to a numeric vecotr and then once more converted to a factor vector. The dataset size, mean, median and proportion of cases where the logical vector was TRUE is outlined below:

The size of the dataset is 1000, 3; 1000 rows and 3 columns.

The mean of the x is 0.0595971.

The median of the x is 0.0459858.

The proportion of case for which the logical vector is TRUE is 0.513.

Scatterplots
------------

``` r
# Making scatter plots for logical, numeric and factor vectors, respectively.

Plot_1 = ggplot(Problem2_df, aes(x = y, y = x)) + geom_point(aes(color = vec_logical))

# The blue data points on the scatterplot represent the values which are TRUE.
# The pink data points represent those values that are FALSE.


Plot_2 = ggplot(Problem2_df, aes(x = y, y = x)) + geom_point(aes(color = vec_numeric))

# The blue data points represent values numeric values equal to 1.00.
# The black data points represent numeric values that are equal to 0.00. 

Plot_3 = ggplot(Problem2_df, aes(x = y, y = x)) + geom_point(aes(color = vec_factor))

# The blue data points represent factor variables that are TRUE.
# The blue data points relect factor variables that are FALSE.
```

``` r
# Exporting Plot_1 as a .pdf, to the folder in project directory.

ggsave("Plot_1.pdf", path = "./P8105_HW1_BJL2150_files")
```
